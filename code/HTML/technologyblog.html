            <div style="font-size: 25px;text-align: justify;">
                Grocery retailing companies are increasingly adopting a number of technological innovations in order to
                improve the shopping experience of their customers by using those technologies in their stores. Through
                implementation of such advancements as self-checkout kiosks, mobile applications, and RFID technology,
                these
                stores are trying to simplify the processes and offer more convenience to shoppers. Along with
                self-checkout
                stations, clients can quickly finish their transactions without any queues and bother at the traditional
                cash desks. Mobile apps give users functionality such as offers individualized to their purchase
                history,
                shopping lists management, as well as ordering groceries for delivery or pickup thus, customers are
                empowered with more control over their shopping experience. Moreover, the integration of RFID technology
                facilitates the precise inventory tracking, which in turn, makes sure that the shelves are always
                sufficient
                and the cases of the out-of-stock items are eliminated. The improvement in operational efficiency, which
                is
                derived from these technological contributions, leaves customers with the smooth and fun shopping
                experience. (KPS Global , 2024)

                "Technology transforms the traditional shopping experience in supermarkets into a more convenient one
                that meets our tastes and preferences." After the pandemic, online ordering and delivery have become the
                key elements for supermarkets in this way customers can shop from home and get their groceries delivered
                at their doorsteps. This not only makes supermarkets convenient but also allows the supermarkets to sell
                their goods more broadly. Further the aforementioned point, supermarkets are using technology to
                customize the shopping experience. Through the customer data analysis, they will be able to comprehend
                the shopping trends and make individualized suggestions. Retail chains, for instance, are appending
                augmented reality to generate interactive and immersive shopping experiences that are more fun and
                engaging, consequently making a visit to the store more interesting and exciting.
                Online ordering and delivery arrangements have come to be of great significance to supermarkets by the
                time COVID-19 came. This implies that you do not have to go to the store to get your groceries because
                you can just shop from home and get them delivered. (Mura, 2023)

               There are some darkside of technology in daily life of people and business. Firstly, technology makes people close with the gadgets and far from people that will hamper the socialization among people in the society. Secondly, it will make us passive as we will be ordering our products by sitting inside the home. Thirdly, there are the groups of cyberattackers that are trying to hack the critial data and information of the people and the business organization.

            <h1 style="font-size: 50px;text-align:left">How technology has affected daily life and business while
                selling grocery items</h1>
            <div style="font-size: 25px;text-align: justify;">



                Different stages of technology development, from domestic to local businesses, have affected the way
                grocery industry operates. Owing to online ordering and delivery services, delivery of groceries at your
                doorstep, convenience is at your finger tip moments. This development delivered both a fuel and time
                saving of the public. Whereas technology has been the win-win of the grocery stores by virtue of
                righteous supply networks, inventory management systems and implementation of automated acquaintance
                procedures, it has had some drawbacks that have been seen by the shoppers. In addition, it has become
                easier for businesses to tailor the shopping experience to the customersâ€™ preferences through the data
                they have about their preferences which in turn, results in personalizing promotions and
                recommendations. Moreover, through providing realistic shopping experience, mobile and online platforms
                address the needs of larger group of the audience, e.g. those with limited mobility or who may not be
                able to go shopping in the stores for various reasons. Recent advancements, such as self-checkout kiosks
                and augmented reality tricks, can as well be the reason for the process becoming interactive and fun. In
                essence, technological developments have altered the grocery business, making it more accessible,
                productive and customer oriented.

                Finally, we can say that the role of technology in the grocery industry is to make it more convenient, easy and customer-centered by bringing out various changes. Even though all the problems that technology development will cause, the advantages are so huge that they outweigh the disadvantages, which mean a better shopping experience for customers.
